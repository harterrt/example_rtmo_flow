# Example RTMO Reports

This repo contains some example reports to test RTMO against.
You can see the resulting PRs for 
the Jupyter document [here](https://github.com/harterrt/mozilla-reports/tree/examples/triangle.kp/examples/triangle.kp)
and the Rmd Document [here](https://github.com/harterrt/mozilla-reports/tree/examples/triangle_rmd.kp/examples/triangle_rmd.kp)
.

The commands for adding and updating documents are a bit unweildy.
We'll have to do something about that.
You can see the exact commands used to create these PRs in the
[command_log file](command_log.txt).
